Up to you.\n\n### What's Inside?\n\n- [`<TimeInput>`](https://github.com/hellojwilde/react-pick-datetime/blob/master/src/TimeInput.js) - Autocompleting time input, where the user can type a time, and times similar to the one that they're typing get autocompleted in both a menu and in \"type ahead\" text.\n- [`<DateInput>`](https://github.com/hellojwilde/react-pick-datetime/blob/master/src/DateInput.js) - Input with a keyboard-navigable calendar popup letting the user select and modify dates.",
